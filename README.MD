# Alexander Cochrane's Developer Test

Thank you for having me run through your developer test today! It's nice to step away from the projects we work on all day to try out a skill testing question. Below are the instructions you will need to get this thing up and running

### Instructions
1. Install Vagrant (can be downloaded [here](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html))
2. Download the repository
3. In the console, run `vagrant up`
4. Import the database (included in `devtest.sql`)
5. Open up a browser and go to `localhost:8008/inbox.php`
